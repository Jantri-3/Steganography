Error depending on .png or .txt file missing
Faster when comparision if payload and current channel are 1 and then do nothing??
Implement check if payload fits into picture
Somehow embedd length of payload to be able to extract payload
--> Hide in metadata under disclaimer
Embedd time in metadata as well
- Use 0 - 24 time when it is real
- If it contains am or pm it is fake
